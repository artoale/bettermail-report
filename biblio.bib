  abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach that uses structure as well as the content of emails in a folder for email classification. Our approach is based on the premise that representative – common and recurring – structures/patterns can be extracted from a pre-classified email folder and the same can be used effectively for clas- sifying incoming emails. A number of factors that influence representative structure extraction and the classification are analyzed conceptually and validated experimentally. In our approach, the notion of inexact graph match is leveraged for deriving structures that provide coverage for characterizing folder contents. Extensive experimentation validate the se- lection of parameters and the effectiveness of our approach for email classification.},

  abstract = {We present two prediction problems under the rubric of In- telligent Email that are designed to support enhanced email interfaces that relieve the stress of email overload. Reply prediction alerts users when an email requires a response and facilitates email response management. Attachment predic- tion alerts users when they are about to send an email miss- ing an attachment or triggers a document recommendation system, which can catch missing attachment emails before they are sent. Both problems use the same underlying email classification system and task specific features. Each task is evaluated for both single-user and cross-user settings.},

@book{Manco2008,
  abstract = {The continuous exchange of information by means of the popular email service has raised the problem of managing the huge amounts of messages received from users in an effective and efficient way. We deal with the problem of email classification by conceiving suitable strategies for: (1) organizing messages into homogeneous groups, (2) redirecting further incoming messages according to an initial organization, and (3) building reliable descriptions of the message groups discovered. We propose a unified framework for handling and classifying email messages. In our framework, messages sharing similar features are clustered in a folder organization. Clustering and pattern discovery techniques for mining struc- tured and unstructured information from email messages are the basis of an overall process of folder creation/maintenance and email redirection. Pattern discovery is also exploited for generating suitable cluster descriptions that play a leading role in cluster updating. Experimental evaluation performed on several personal mailboxes shows the effectiveness of our approach.},

@book{Manning2008,
  abstract = {Class-tested and coherent, this groundbreaking new textbook teaches web-era information retrieval, including web search and the related areas of text classification and text clustering from basic concepts. Written from a computer science perspective by three leading experts in the field, it gives an up-to-date treatment of all aspects of the design and implementation of systems for gathering, indexing, and searching documents; methods for evaluating systems; and an introduction to the use of machine learning methods on text collections. All the important ideas are explained using examples and figures, making it perfect for introductory courses in information retrieval for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science. Based on feedback from extensive classroom experience, the book has been carefully structured in order to make teaching more natural and effective. Although originally designed as the primary text for a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in information retrieval, the book will also create a buzz for researchers and professionals alike.},
